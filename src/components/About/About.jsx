        <p>My name is <strong>Federico Anelli</strong> and I am a <strong>Computer Systems Engineer</strong> living in <strong>Buenos Aires, Argentina ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡·. </strong></p>
        
        <p><br />I'm currently studying <strong>Backend Development @ Coderhouse</strong> to get my <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> certification, after having recently obtained my <strong>Front End Developer</strong> certification.</p>
        
        <p><br />I'm also a <strong>Professional Scrum Product Owner (PSPO I)</strong> certified by <strong>Scrum.org</strong>.</p>

        <p><br />Currently, I am <strong>Head of Digital Product & Technology</strong> for <strong>Radio Disney in Latin America</strong> (Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Chile, Uruguay, Ecuador, Bolivia, Paraguay, Peru, Panama, Dominican Republic & Costa Rica).</p>
        
        <p><br />While I'm open to relocation opportunities to the EU or USA, I'm also available for Front End Development projects or Digital consulting.</p>

        <p><br />My passion for building digital products started back when I was 11 years old in 2001. Back then, I used to spend most of my free time creating websites at GeoCities (amazing times).</p>

        <p><br />This is the first website I've ever made:</p>
